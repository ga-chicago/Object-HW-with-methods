// CLICKER
//1. Make an object called clicker, which has a clickCount property, and a click method.
//2. Have the click method increment the clickCount by 1 each time it is called.

const clicker = {
	clickCount: 0,
	click () {
		return this.clickCount += 1
	}
}



// IT'S ALL ABOUT ME
//1. Create an object called myInformation.
//2. Assign to it your name, your current age, and a fact about you.
//3. Inside myInformation, create a method called statement that returns a statement about you including your name, 
//	 this fact, and how old you will be in 10 years.
//4. Inside myInformation, create another function that can be used to increment the value of your age by 1 each time that you call it.

const myInformation = {
 	name: 'Alyssa',
 	age: 28,
 	fact: 'I play ultimate frisbee.',
 	statement () {
 		const agePlus10 = this.age += 10;
 		return "I am " + this.name + " and I am 28." + this.fact + " I will be " + agePlus10 + " in 10 years.";
 	},
 	increaseAge () {
 		const ageIncrease = this.age += 1;
 		return ageIncrease
 	},
 	changeName (name) {
 		newName = name
		return this.name = newName
 	}
}

//5. It's your birthday! Call this new method that you made that will increase your age.
myInformation.increaseAge();

//6. Create another function that can be used to change the value of your name.

// SEE ABOVE

//7. You're feeling funky and decide that your new name is Rumpelstiltskin. Call the method that will update your name 
//	 and assign this new name. Log your object to confirm the changes.
myInformation.changeName("Rumpelstiltskin");
myInformation; //<--- returns object info with new name Rumpelstiltskin assigned



//GREETER
//1. Create an object called greeter.
//2. Inside the greeter object, create a method called hello that takes a name as a parameter and returns a greeting message 
//	 followed by the name parameter.
//3. Create another method inside greeter called goodbye that takes a name as a parameter and returns a farewell greeting followed 
//	 by the name parameter.
//4. Create a final method inside greeter called whoAreYou that takes a name as a parameter and returns "Oh right! ", followed by the 
//	 name parameter, followed by " how could I forget...!"

const greet = {
	hello (name) {
		return "Oh hello there, " + name
	},
	goodbye (name) {
		return "Hasta maÃ±ana, " + name
	},
	whoAreYou (name) {
		return "Oh right! " + name + " how could I forget...!"
	}
}

//5. Play around executing your functions by accessing them through the object.
// <-- All worked - yay!



//COLLECTING STRINGS
// Make an object called stringCollector, which has:
// 1. a collection property - an array to hold strings
// 2. a collect method which takes a string as a parameter
// 3. the string collector prefers the strings to be totally reversed in their collection, however, 
//	  so make sure to reverse it before adding it to the collection
// 4. add an admireCollection method which prints out each string in the collection to the console, one line at a time

const stringCollector = {
	collection: [],
	collect (string) {
		let newString = string.split("");
		let reverseString = newString.reverse();
		return this.collection.push(reverseString.join(""))
	},
	admireCollection () {
			for(element of stringCollector.collection) {
				console.log(element)
			}
		}
}

for(row of foo77) {
	// console.log(row) <---all the rows
	for(element of row) {
		console.log(element)
	}
}



//ATM
// Make an object called atm which has two properties:
// 1. totalCash, the total amount of cash in the atm
// 2. dispenseTwenties, a method with takes a number of twenties and, if there is enough cash, returns the total 
//	  number of cash it is giving out.
// 3. If there is not enough cash, return null instead.

const atm = {
	totalCash: 200,
	dispenseTwenties (num) {
		// take out cash in multiples of 20
		const dollaBills = num * 20;
		const amountRequested = this.totalCash - dollaBills;
		if(amountRequested <= 0) { 
			return null;
		}
		return amountRequested
	}
}



//HUNGRY TURTLES

//1. Create an object called Leonardo.
//2. Leonardo should have a name attribute of "Leonardo", a color attribute of "Blue", and a weapon attribute of "Katana".
//3. Leonardo should also have a boolean property called pizzaEaten that is initially set to false.
//4. Add a method to Leonardo called eatPizza() which does the following:
//		 If pizzaEaten is true, print out "Leonardo has already eaten pizza" and set pizzaEaten to false.
// 		 If pizzaEaten is false, print out "Leonardo is eating pizza" and set pizzaEaten to true.

const leonardo = {
	name: "Leonardo",
	color: "blue",
	weapon: "Katana",
	pizzaEaten: false,
	eatPizza () {
		if(this.pizzaEaten === true) {
			leonardo.pizzaEaten = false;
			return this.name + " has already eaten pizza"
		} else if(this.pizzaEaten === false) {
			leonardo.pizzaEaten = true;
			return this.name + " is eating pizza"
		}
	}
}



//CALCULATOR
//1. Create an object called calculator
//2. Create a property called output
//3. Create a method inside your object that will multiply two numbers and change the output value to this current value. 
//	 This method should also log the value of output.
//4. Create a function that will divide two numbers. It should also change the output value to this current value. 
//	 This method should also log the value of output.
//5. Practice using your calculator with some pairs (10, 2), (-2, 8), (2, 2).
//6. If there's additional time, add methods for addition and subtraction

const calculator = {
	property: "output",
	multiply (n1, n2) {
		let newValue = n1 * n2;
		calculator.property = newValue;
		return newValue
	},
	divide (n1, n2) {
		let newValue = n1 / n2
		calculator.property = newValue;
		return newValue
	},
	add (n1, n2) {
		let newValue = n1 + n2
		calculator.property = newValue;
		return newValue
	},
	sub (n1, n2) {
		let newValue = n1 - n2
		calculator.property = newValue;
		return newValue
	}
}
