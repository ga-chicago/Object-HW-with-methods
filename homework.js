//It's All About Me

// Create an object called myInformation.
// Assign to it your name, your current age, and a fact about you.
// Inside myInformation, create a method called statement that returns a statement about you including your name, this fact, and how old you will be in 10 years.

// Inside myInformation, create another function that can be used to increment the value of your age by 1 each time that you call it.

// It's your birthday! Call this new method that you made that will increase your age.
// Create another function that can be used to change the value of your name.
// You're feeling funky and decide that your new name is Rumpelstiltskin. Call the method that will update your name and assign this new name. Log your object to confirm the changes.

// Collecting Strings

// Make an object called stringCollector, which has:

// a collection property - an array to hold strings
// a collect method which takes a string as a parameter
// the string collector prefers the strings to be totally reversed in their collection, however, so make sure to reverse it before adding it to the collection
// add an admireCollection method which prints out each string in the collection to the console, one line at a time
// ðŸ”´ The commit message should read: 
// "Commit 4 - Collecting Strings done"


// const stringCollector = [
	// 'string',
	// () => (string)
